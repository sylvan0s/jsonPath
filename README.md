# jsonPath

## What is jsonPath ?

Have you ever used xpath when working on a XML file ? It's crazy.

When you work with JSON files, it's becomes a mess when you need to access data(s) on multiple level. Lots and lots of foreach / conditions...

But now, with jsonPath, parsing a JSON file haven't been so easy !

## How to use jsonPath ?

All you need to do is to import "class/jsonPath.php" to your project.

Check out [example.php](https://github.com/sylvan0s/jsonPath/blob/master/example.php) to have hint on how to use jsonPath ;)
